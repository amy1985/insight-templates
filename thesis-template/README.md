# Thesis Template:

This is the template that has passed on through emails over the last couple of years.

`main.tex` is the main document that compiles a pdf. There are some options in commented out TeX code.

Thesis content should be in files in `chapters\`:

```
chapters/0_abstract.tex
chapters/1_introduction.tex
chapters/2_contributions.tex
chapters/3_body.tex
chapters/4_conclusions.tex
```

### Some Useful things:

Compile a plain text version for external grammar / spelling / style checkers:

`detex main.tex > plain_text.txt`

`corrections.tex` is a useful template to write up a report on your corrections after you pass your viva, i believe in you! \o/
